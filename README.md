Mycotoxin detection- A data driven approach for ensuring data safety
Our project Mycotoxin Detection in Foods for making sure the safety of the food 
and Reliability addresses a critical concern in the terms of food security and public 
health. Mycotoxins these are toxic compounds produced by fungi, producing
significant risks to human and animal health when present in food which are then 
in taken by them. Detecting these contaminants plays important role for ensuring 
the safety and reliability of food supplies. This project employs the principle 
working of CNN for detecting specific substances mycotoxin patterns in the food 
item, to identify mycotoxins in food materials swiftly and accurately. By 
harnessing the power of CNNs, the project aims to provide food safety officers, 
farmers, and consumers with timely information regarding the presence of 
mycotoxins in food products,not only the officials but the accessibility is for public 
too. Through the integration of machine learning techniques, particularly utilizing 
datasets related to fungal growth, the project enhances the efficiency and accuracy 
of mycotoxin detection. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast amounts of data 
to identify patterns associated with fungal contamination, thereby enabling early 
detection and intervention measures. By including CNNs and other machine 
learning concepts, this project not only contributes to the advancement of food 
safety technologies but also empowers stakeholders across the food supply chain to 
make informed decisions regarding food quality and safety. Ultimately, the 
implementation of this innovative approach facilitates proactive measures to 
mitigate the risks posed by mycotoxins, safeguarding public health and enhancing 
the reliability of the global food system.
